1 # scaler interval length in seconds
3 # MFC to reference for calculating concentrations.  1 = MFC1, 2 = MFC2, 3 = MFC1+MFC2 (for multiple stables on the MFCs)
10 # time duration for smoothing ( displays visual trend only, no data output). must be integer multiple of scaler interval
1 # plot the data? 1 for yes, 0 for no (though in reality, any integer other than 1 will not create a plot) 
1 # write the data to file? 1 for yes, 0 for no (though in reality, any integer other than 1 will not write to file) 
0 # number of cuts to use in the analysis
